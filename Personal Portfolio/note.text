Homework Assignment: Build a Simple Personal Portfolio Page
Hey class, for this week's homework, you're going to put together what we've learned so far in HTML basics and CSS. 
Create a single webpage that acts as your personal portfolio. It should include a navigation bar,
some styled text, links (internal and external), and a bit of formatting. Keep it simpleâ€”no need for fancy stuff yet.

Requirements:
HTML Structure:
Use proper DOCTYPE, head, and body tags.

Include a <title> tag with something like "My Portfolio".

Add semantic elements: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.

Create at least 3 sections: About Me, Projects, and Contact.

Use headings (<h1> to <h3>), paragraphs (<p>), and an unordered list (<ul>) for projects.

Links and Navigation:
Build a <nav> with a <ul> of links: Home (links to #home), About (#about), Projects (#projects),
 Contact (#contact). Use bookmark links to jump to sections on the same page

Add one external link, like to your favorite website (e.g., <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>).
Include an email link in the Contact section: <a href="mailto:your.email@example.com">Email Me</a>.

CSS Styling:
Link an external CSS file (create a file called styles.css).
Style the body: Set a background color (e.g., light gray) and font family (e.g., Arial).
Make the nav horizontal: Use display: inline for <li> items, remove bullets, add padding/margins.
Style links: Different colors for hover (e.g., red on hover) and visited (e.g., purple).
Center the main content and add borders or padding to sections for visual separation.
Make headings bold and larger (e.g., h1 { font-size: 2em; color: navy; }).
